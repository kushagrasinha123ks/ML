Welcome to the ML/AI Projects Repository !

## Projects

Here's a brief overview of the projects included in this repository:

**E-Commerce Churn Analysis** :

- Used six classification models - Logistic Regression, LDA, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, and Xgboostâ€”to conduct churn analysis in the e-commerce industry.
- To address imbalanced datasets, a variety of machine learning approaches were used, such as clustering and oversampling.
- The Random Forest classifier yielded a maximum accuracy of 98%.

**Bitcoin (BTC) Price Forecasting** :

- To acquire Bitcoin price data for the past 10 years, QuandlAPI and Yahoo Finance API are used.
- Trained and optimized an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model with a 1.57 SMAPE % and an RMSE score of 845.54. 
- The data was assessed and converted for stationarity, and forecasts using the ARIMA model were made for the ensuing five days.
